I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in systems neuroscience with [Laura
Busse](http://neuro.bio.lmu.de/research_groups/res-busse_l/index.html) in the [Vision Circuits
Lab](https://visioncircuitslab.org) at [LMU München](https://www.lmu.de) in Germany. I
graduated with a PhD in Neuroscience from [UBC](http://ubc.ca) in [Nick
Swindale's](http://swindale.ecc.ubc.ca) lab in Vancouver, Canada, and before that with a BSc
in Engineering Physics from the [University of Alberta](https://ualberta.ca) in Edmonton,
Canada.

My original interests lie in [systems
neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_neuroscience) and [computational
neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience), specifically the
activity of neural assemblies in the brain during naturalistic stimulation and varying brain
states, and at millisecond timescales. I have a notion that what we learn about the rules of
neural interactions governing perception, memory, decision making and ultimately behaviour,
can be generalized to other complex systems of interacting agents -- like, perhaps, human
beings making up a society. This might be a naïve notion, but I hope not.

My [ORCiD page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9519-3284) lists all of my publications, and my
[Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mspacek) has some more details about my academic
and work history.

Here is my PhD thesis (June, 2015): [Characterizing patches of primary visual cortex with
minimal bias](mspacek_thesis.pdf)

However, I've also long been interested in renewable energy, the electrification of transport,
and decarbonization in general. Perhaps if we humans were better at group decision making, we
would act more rationally overall and find ourselves in fewer crises.

Over the years, I've also realized how much I enjoy the broad methods that were required
during my BSc, PhD, and postdoc, including data acquisition, instrumentation, programming, and analysis.
As an example, [rpimv](https://github.com/mspacek/rpimv) is a recent Raspberry Pi project I
put together that serves 9 degree of freedom IMU data and GPS data over TCP/IP. It's
impressive what can be accomplished these days with only a couple hundred lines of source
code.

My [GitHub account page](https://github.com/mspacek) shows some of the public software projects
I've created or contributed to, though others remain in private repos.

I have three major public projects here: [dimstim](https://dimstim.github.io),
[spyke](https://spyke.github.io), and [neuropy](https://neuropy.github.io). The first generates
multidimensional visual stimuli with high temporal precision. The second takes raw
extracellular neural waveforms and sorts them into spikes from distinct neurons. The third
analyzes spike trains in as many ways as possible.

In the Busse lab, among other projects, I work on an internal project based on
[datajoint](https://datajoint.io) for organizing and analyzing data in a relational database.
