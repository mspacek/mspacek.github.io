I'm a recent PhD graduate in neuroscience at [UBC](http://ubc.ca), in [Nick Swindale's
lab](http://swindale.ecc.ubc.ca). My interest lies in [computational
neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience), more specifically,
the activity of neural assemblies in the brain. I have a notion that what we learn about the
rules of neural interaction governing perception, memory, decision making and ultimately
behaviour, can be generalized to other complex systems of interacting agents -- like, perhaps,
human beings making up a society. This might be a naive notion.

I have three projects here: [dimstim](http://dimstim.github.io),
[spyke](http://spyke.github.io), and [neuropy](http://neuropy.github.io). The first generates
multidimensional visual stimuli with high temporal precision. The second takes raw
extracellular neural waveforms and sorts them into spikes from distinct neurons. The third
analyzes spike trains in as many ways as possible.

Here's my [CV](CV.pdf).

Here's my [PhD thesis](mspacek_thesis.pdf).
