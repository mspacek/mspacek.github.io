I'm a recent PhD graduate in neuroscience from [Nick Swindale's](http://swindale.ecc.ubc.ca)
lab at [UBC](http://ubc.ca). I'm now a postdoc in [Laura
Busse's](http://www.cin.uni-tuebingen.de/research/research-groups/junior-research-groups/cortical-circuits-of-visual-perception/research-directions.html)
lab, currently at the [University of Tübingen](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/en.html) in
Germany, but moving soon to [LMU München](http://www.en.biologie.uni-muenchen.de). My interest
lies in [computational
neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience), more specifically,
the activity of neural assemblies in the brain. I have a notion that what we learn about the
rules of neural interaction governing perception, memory, decision making and ultimately
behaviour, can be generalized to other complex systems of interacting agents -- like, perhaps,
human beings making up a society. This might be a naïve notion.

I have three projects here: [dimstim](http://dimstim.github.io),
[spyke](http://spyke.github.io), and [neuropy](http://neuropy.github.io). The first generates
multidimensional visual stimuli with high temporal precision. The second takes raw
extracellular neural waveforms and sorts them into spikes from distinct neurons. The third
analyzes spike trains in as many ways as possible.

Here's my [CV](CV.pdf).

Here's my PhD thesis (June, 2015): [Characterizing patches of primary visual cortex with
minimal bias](mspacek_thesis.pdf)

Here's the resulting manuscript based on one of the chapters: [Cortical state and natural
movie responses in cat visual cortex](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/031765)

Here's the [corresponding poster](BCCN_Sparks_2016_poster.pdf), presented most recently at
[BCCN Sparks
2016](http://www.bccn-munich.de/talks-events/workshop-multichannel-interfacing-of-neuronal-networks).

Here's my [GitHub account page](http://github.com/mspacek) and my former [lab
page](http://swindale.ecc.ubc.ca/MartinSpacek).
